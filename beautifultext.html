      <h1>Beautiful Text</h1>
      <h2>A Cheat Sheet for Better Typography</h2>
      <h3>Ian Millington</h3>
      
      <p>
        This document details a bunch of classical rules for typesetting
        text. That is, for designing how text will look and how it will
        be laid out on the page. These rules are <em>classical</em> &#8211;
        they are drawn from the long tradition of book typography, and aren't
        specifically written for the web. They are the rules that any good
        book designer starts from and are given roughly in order of importance
        and I've tried to roughly honor each rule as I describe it, although
        that isn't always visible. The page is written in HTML 5, so legacy
        browsers may not recognise the style rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you find your text seems to be ugly or not feel quite sharp enough,
        follow these rules and your
        typography will immediately look more professional. Of course, a 
        really good typographer will be able to break all these rules and create
        something great, but then I'm not a great typographer, so if you are,
        there's no point in you reading this!
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the content comes from Jan Tschichold's essays and 
        practice. He was both an excellent typographer and a scholar and
        codifier of classical techniques.

<div id="type">
    <section>
      <h1>Type Selection</h1>
      
      <p>
        Use a serif typeface for good looking body text. First-language
        English readers recognize words by their shape, a particular pattern
        of ink (or pixels), of whitespace, of length of ascenders and 
        descender and of word-length. This skill has been honed over the 
        many years it took for you to learn to read
        and is hardwired into your brain. As a designer it makes sense to 
        leverage this brain wiring, and not to fight it. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Sans-serif faces can also be very readable, when they follow the 
        proportions of classic serif style. At small pixel sizes they
        may even be clearer (for reasons I'll cover below). But they will 
        never look as elegant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Avoid
        typefaces with non-classical proportions. In particular 'condensed'
        and 'geometric' faces
        are popular at the moment (the former use thinner letter shapes, the
        latter have wider variety in their letter width, and often have
        a perfectly circular O). These are not
        good for reading, restrict them to titles.
      </p>
      <p>
        For reading on-screen, the
        tiny spaces in the middle of letters such as 'e' or 's' (called 
        "counters" in the lingo) can easily be lost, so typefaces for screen
        reading tend to have bigger lowercase letters and smaller ascenders 
        and descenders (the bits that stick up and down in letters such as 'd'
        and 'p'). This is called a large "x-height", and for some 
        screen fonts, the height of the 'x' character may be 3/4 the height of
        'X'. For printed output large x-height appears immature and inelegant
        and ratios around 3/5 are common.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use one and only one font for the body text, and one more for titles
        if you have to. Classic book typography usually requires only one.
      </p>

<div id="line_spacing">
    <section>
      <h1>Line-Spacing and Line Width</h1>
      
      <p>
        When you read a block of text, your eye dances along the line,
        stopping every couple of words long enough for your brain to 
        recognize the surrounding shapes (this process is called "fixation").
        This process is relatively simple until you get to the end of the
        line, when the eye has to scan back to its next fixation. This
        process takes a relatively long time, so anything you can do to
        make it faster helps.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Your eye scans back using the little strip of whitespace between
        each line. Increasing this whitespace makes it easier to read. Always
        separate your lines of text a little wider than normal (this is called 
        "setting" your text, so you can have text that is narrow set, or wide 
        set). The easiest way to immediately tell a piece
        of text created by a typographic novice is that the text is set too
        close.
        </p>
      <p>Having said that, if you set your text too wide then the lines won't 
        naturally flow into one another, and this breaks up the rhythm of 
        reading. Double spacing is often too wide, single is always far to small. The 
        precise spacing has to be done by eye: but if you are new to this, then 
        err on the side of wider line-spacing.</p><p> Line spacing is sometimes called
        "leading", because in the days of hand-set metal type it was achieved
        with a thin strip of lead between each row of letters.
        Unfortunately you measure "leading" differently to "line-spacing", and
        most software uses the latter measurement (even though some still 
        call it "leading"). Since we aren't really going to be doing leading I'd advise
        against using the term.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The second factor in helping the eye pick up the start of the next
        line is line-length. If your lines are too long, then the eye has
        to work harder to scan back along the white space to pick up the
        next line. If they are too short then your eye has to pick up the
        next line more frequently. Both of these extremes make reading harder.
        It has been found that a line of between 8 and 12 words is the
        best compromise. This is why newspapers and magazines use columns.
        Multiple columns are a big pain with scrolling on-screen, but filling 
        the width of a HTML page in text is a recipe for unreadable text.
      </p>

     <p>
       For both of these reasons, a general rule is to have more line-spacing
       for longer lines.
     </p>
    </section>
    
    <div id="capitals">
        <section>
          <h1>Spacing Capitals</h1>

          <p>In a good typeface,
            capitals are never designed to sit next to one
            another in words. The font designer will structure them with spacing
            rules (called "kerning") for acronyms. When used in titles, for 
            example, they will be <em>far</em> too close together. Remember
            you have a hardwired brain for reading lowercase. But for upper-case
            you will have to process much more off each word. Having more space
            between upper-case letters makes this easier (conversely if you letter
            space lower-case you break the brain's ability to scan the word, making
            it far <em>harder</em> to read).
          </p>

          <p>
            All text in capitals should be set with extra letter-spacing, and that
            absolutely includes text in small-caps. Normally software allows you
            to do this either as a percentage of the text-size, or by adding
            a point or two of spacing between letters. Proper typography needs
            capitals to be manually spaced, because of all sorts of complex 
            interactions between the capital forms. But this is almost impossible
            for most folks to do well. Even so, some spacing is much, much better
            than none. In CSS this can be achieved with the 
            <code>letter-spacing</code> property.
          </p>

          <p>
            Properly spaced capitals for headings can be smaller than you might
            think too. You don't have to double the size of the body text to
            get a good looking heading.
          </p>

<div id="indent_color">
<div id="color">
    <section>
      <h1>Off-Black Text, Off-White Ground</h1>
        
      <p>
        The way our brain is optimized to recognize word shapes is also the main reason
        to only use dark text on a light background. Anything else will confuse
        the brain's dedicated word detectors and will make the reader 
        work harder. It isn't <em>difficult</em> to read inverted text, but it 
        involves more work than regular text.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        But that doesn't mean black-on-white. If you look at a classic book
        typography, you'll see the pages are really quite off-white. They
        are creams, light browns, or pale oranges. The inks also aren't 
        jet-black, they are slightly transparent, picking up the color of the 
        underlying paper. They <em>appear</em> black, but only in comparison.
        The most beautiful books have really rather dark pages, and really
        quite transparent inks. The contrast doesn't have to be so high, 
        as long as the patterns of light and dark are not obscured.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In book design near-white paper is only ever justified for full-color 
        work. Then you do want black ink, because otherwise the color of the
        ink will show up next to blacks in the artwork. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        One of the main reasons
        it is hard to read on-screen is the sheer amount of contrast that
        a screen provides. Because the whites are actively pumping out light,
        rather than just reflecting it,
        the contrast between black and white is far greater
        than for the printed page. This is fatiguing. If you want to 
        read comfortably, reduce the contrast. But not too much &#8211;
        otherwise letterforms will begin to be indistinct and the brain
        will have to work harder to recognize the word forms.
      </p>
    </section>
    
<div id="paragraphs">
    <section>
      <h1>Separating Paragraphs</h1>
      
      <p>
        Paragraphs are units of thought within a piece of writing. Originally
        they were indicated with a special symbol, the pilcrow
        (<span style="color:#c00">¶</span>). These
        symbols were to be written in red. The job of adding the red text
        to the page was often done by a different person (the "rubricator",
        also where we get "rubric"). To make the paragraph break clearer
        a new line might also be started. The primary scribe would leave a 
        gap for the
        pilcrow. With the omission of the pilcrow, we ended up with
        the newline plus indent form we have today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typewriter users found it inconvenient and inconsistent to produce
        this indent (a tab was often far too large, and getting just the right
        number of spaces was error prone), so used blank lines. Early WYSIWYG
        word processors found it easier to do the same rather than implement
        the special logic needed to handle paragraph indents with justified
        text. So it became common. 
      </p>
      <p>
        CSS now makes it simple to use proper paragraph indents, with a rule
        such as <code>p + p { text-indent: 1em; }</code>. And all 
        word-processors now support it. The optimum indent should be about
        the same size as the spacing between consecutive lines. For wide
        set text this is a bit too large, so a good rule of thumb is to use
        the same width as the size of the typeface (i.e. 14pt indent for 14pt
        text). This quantity is also called the 'em', hence the CSS rule above.
      </p>
      <p>
        Good typography does not use 
        vertical space for paragraph breaks because it breaks the rhythm of 
        reading:
        as your eye scans back to the start of each line, your brain adjusts
        to the amount of vertical change needed to hit the right spot. As
        you continue reading this process gets faster and faster as your brain
        gets better at guessing where the next line will start. Paragraph
        spacing breaks this rhythm and makes reading harder.
      </p>
    </section>
    
<div id="variations">
    <section>
      <h1>Font Variations</h1>
      
      <p>
        There are only two font variations needed in good typography, and they
        are <em>italic</em> and small capitals. Italic is intended to represent 
        something written
        by hand, as such it has a more flowing form. In some fonts 
        (particularly Sans-serif) it is generated by skewing the letters
        sideways. This isn't italic it is an oblique, and is very inferior.
        Small capitals is used as lead-in to a block of text, and for
        certain common acronyms written without periods (such as AD, or BC).
        Unfortunately most free and bundled typefaces don't have small-caps
        and most word-processors fake it with using capital letters at a 
        smaller size. This is universally disastrous, as every capital
        will then appear to be in bold relative to the surrounding text, 
        the height of the small-caps will rarely match the x-height of the
        surrounding lowercase, and the letter-spacing of the small caps
        will be plain ugly. For that reason I'd advise you only to use 
        small-caps if you know you have a genuine small-caps in your font, 
        and your target display can use it (which pretty much excludes 
        web-use).
      </p> 
            
      <p>
        Except in specialist text forms such as encyclopedia, indices, or
        dictionaries, bold is rarely used. It isn't clear what the difference
        should be. Why do you need two categories of emphasis (HTML's 
        distinction between emphasis and "strong" is entirely artificial).
        Bold titles are beloved by HTML, but they are very rare in the text
        of books. A larger point size is perfectly adequate.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Underlined text is a complete anachronism. It is an editor's symbol
        to indicate that a piece of text should be made italic. It was then
        used in typewriters to indicate the same (typewriters couldn't type
        in italic, of course). It is now associated with hypertext links
        on the web, where it is useful, although is often redundant when
        the link text also has a different color. Regardless, the underline
        will be far too close to the text, ruining its shape. A better approach
        is to turn off underlining and use a CSS <code>bottom-border</code> with
        a tiny bit of padding. Even better is to use an underline color with 
        lower contrast (which you can do for a border, but not for a
        regular underline), an underline that appears only on hover, or a 
        dotted underline.
      </p>
    </section>
    
<div id="justified">
    <section>
      <h1>Justification and Hyphenation</h1>
      
      <p>
        Justification is the process of giving text a smooth right-margin.
        It is very common in good typography and almost universal in books.
        Its effect is to give the overall text an improved shape and make
        the page more beautiful. By giving you a consistent jump back to the
        start of the next line, it could theoretically improve readability,
        unfortunately its drawbacks (as we'll see) more than make up for this
        improvement. So its only remaining purpose is the beauty of the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, justified text has some more significant problems.
        In order to justify text, you change the spacing between words. This
        is ideally a change by a few percent and is quite unnoticeable. 
        If you have
        short lines, or long words, there may be no convenient break point,
        or there may be few inter-word spaces to increase. You end up with
        very large word spaces, which at best break the flow of the reading,
        but at worse (combined with small line-spacing) produce distracting
        vertical 
        white-space artifacts in the page (called "rivers of white"). If
        your lines are short enough to be readable, then the chances are you
        will hit this problem, and end up with really ugly text. Rivers of
        white is another great give-away for sloppy or amateurish typography.
      </p>
        
      <p>
        The solution that has been used for thousands of years is to sacrifice
        some more readability and use hyphenation to break words falling at 
        the end of the line. A hyphenated word looses all of its shape, and so
        is much harder to read. But this is only the occasional word, and the
        overall effect is more pleasing on the eye.
</p><p>
        Performing the hyphenation is a really hard problem (fine typography 
        still relies on manual hyphenation at
        times, most well designed books use pretty sophisticated algorithmic
        approaches). Historically texts have even been rewritten to allow 
        for better patterns of line-breaking. Unfortunately browsers don't do 
        hyphenation, so you're caught between two evils: either use too-long 
        lines, or face the ugly rivers of white effect. The solution is simple: 
        if you don't have
        access to good hyphenation, or longer line-lengths, use a left text 
        align (also called "ragged right") which is the default for HTML. 
        Current full
        justification on the web just isn't good enough.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h1>Line Breaks<br>for Longer Titles</h1>
      
      <p>
        For titles, strap lines or section headings, never allow your line
        to be broken automatically by the computer. Always use manual
        line-breaks. Line-breaks should be added in meaningful
        locations to allow each resulting line to cohere.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        So a computer might break "The Best Places to Fish in Western Alaska" as
        "The Best Places to Fish in Western / Alaska", you want 
        "The Best Places to Fish / in Western Alaska". Or
        "The Best Places / to Fish in Western Alaska" (the second version
        is less
        clear for the flow of meaning, but may be visually better because
        the bottom of the two lines will be slightly longer, and
        this is a more "stable" and visually pleasing text shape). 
        This was never an issue before
        automatic word wrapping in computers. Again it indicates lazy 
        typesetting.
      </p>
    </section>
    
<div id="lead_in">
    <section>
      <h1>Lead-in for First Lines</h1>
      
      <p><span class="lead_in">Good books and magazines</span>
        mark the introduction of a large chunk of text with
        some typographical distinction. This derives from the practice of
        indicating the start of a chapter (originally a bible chapter) with
        a larger illuminated letter. This has transformed into the use of the 
        drop-cap. Drop caps are elegant, but they are hard to control. They
        should take two or three lines of space, should sit on the same baseline 
        as
        the text in the second or third line and extend to the top of the 
        capitals
        in the first line. Many word processors use separate text-boxes to
        house drop-caps, and make this exact positioning almost impossible.
        Faking a drop-cap on the web is possible using <code>float: left</code>,
        but is even more difficult to get lined up correctly (my attempt on this
        page works on some browsers, but is in the wrong location on others).
      </p>
      
      <p>
        After the drop capital it is customary to set the first few words in
        small capitals. Ideally you should choose a set of words that forms
        one unit of meaning, 
        some software chooses a particular number, which can detract
        from the flow. If you don't have small-capitals, then don't allow
        your software to fake them. I've used bold in the past, but that is
        also fairly ugly. Maybe it is better to do nothing.

        In HTML you can set the whole first line in a different form. This
        is far more than you'd expect to see in a book, but can work. I've
        found that setting the lead-in as bold looks better for a whole
        line than a section. Your mileage may vary.
