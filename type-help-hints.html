<script type="hints">
# 01-QU-1-11
1. The `inbox` `brief` recommended that you search for a few files by name.
1. `01-QU-1-11`

# 00-invitation
1. The `01-QU-1-11` recommended that you search for a file by name.
1. `00-invitation`

# 02-EN-1-6-7-10
1. The `inbox` `brief` recommended that you search for a few files by name.
1. `02-EN-1-6-7-10`

# 03-LI-1-4-5-6-7-8-9
1. The `inbox` `brief` recommended that you search for a few files by name.
1. `03-LI-1-4-5-6-7-8-9`

# 04-ST-1-5-8
1. See the hints above.

# 05-DI-1-5
1. `04-ST-1-5-8` will lead you to the next file.
1. "Why don't you come through to the Dining room with me — it should be empty."
1. Start by figuring out the first part of the file name, the time code. (In the next hint, I'll tell you the time code.)
1. It must start with `05`, because it's the scene right after `04-ST-1-5-8`. Next, you'll need to figure out the two-letter code.
1. Look at the two-letter codes of all of the other files you've found so far.
1. The letter codes are locations. `QU` is Quail Lane. `EN` is the Entrance, `LI` is the Living Room, and `ST` is the study. So what would be the location code of the Dining room?
1. The file name starts with `05-DI`. Now, you just have to figure out the numbers that follow.
1. There are two people in this file name.
1. Person 5 is one of the two people. The other one is "John," Person 1.
1. `05-DI-1-5`

# 06-ST-1-11
1. `05-DI-1-5` will lead you to the next file.
1. It's the next time code, `06`.
1. Person 1 (John) says he's going to the study now.
1. It's `06-ST-?????` where `1` is one of the numbers, and the other is "Thornton", the butler.
1. Thornton has been present in another file you've discovered. He refers to everyone very politely. (I'll tell you which scene he's in in the next hint.)
1. In `01-QU-1-11`, Person 11 refers to John most politely.
1. `06-ST-1-11`

# 00-references
1. `06-ST-1-11` recommended that you search for a file by name.
1. `00-references`

# 04-BI-6-9
1. There's another room mentioned in `03-LI-1-4-5-6-7-8-9`
1. Person 9 says, "Eddie? Could you follow me to the Billiard room, please — I'd like a private word." Using this line, you can reason out another location.
1. Start by figuring out the first part of the file name, the time code. (In the next hint, I'll tell you the time code.)
1. It must start with `04`, because it's the scene right after `03-LI-1-4-5-6-7-8-9`. Next, you'll need to figure out the two-letter code.
1. Look at the two-letter codes of all of the other files you've found so far.
1. The letter codes are locations. `QU` is Quail Lane. `EN` is the Entrance, `LI` is the Living Room, and `ST` is the study. So what would be the location code of the Billiard room?
1. The file name starts with `04-BI`. Now, you just have to figure out the numbers that follow.
1. There are two people in this file name.
1. Person 9 is one of the two people. The other one is "Eddie." Which person is that?
1. Review `02-EN-1-6-7-10`.
1. This passage:
<blockquote>[7] Eddie, what's going on? Who's this?

<p>[6] I'm in the middle of talking to him, Vic!</blockquote>
1. Eddie is Person 6.
1. `04-BI-6-9`

# 01-BI-6-10
1. `04-BI-6-9` will lead you to the next file.
1. The next file is at an earlier time code.
1. This passage:
<blockquote>[6] It's nothing. We just... We lost the ring. But I know it's in here somewhere.

<p>[9] Excuse me?

<p>[6] I have it under control. She lost it just as there was a knock at the front door, and I haven't had a chance to look for it yet.</blockquote>
1. Eddie was in the Billiard room at an earlier time code. Use a process of elimination to figure out which time code.
1. Eddie was in the Living room `LI` at time `03`, and at the entrance `EN` at time `02`, so he must have been in the Billiard room at time `01`.
1. The file you're looking for is `01-BI-?????` where `6` is one of the people in the scene.
1. He was having an argument with his fiancée, so you can guess that there was only one other person in the Billiard room at time `01`.
1. He was in the room with the daughter of Person 9.
1. The daughter of Person 9 wasn't in `03-LI-1-4-5-6-7-8-9`. Use process of elimination.
1. `01-BI-6-10`.

# 02-LI-5-8-9
1. `03-LI-1-4-5-6-7-8-9` will lead you to the next file.
1. "Four more people enter the Living room."
1. The file you're looking for is `02-LI-?????`.
1. There are seven people in this scene, so there were three people in the Living room at time `02`.
1. Persons 1, 6, and 7 were at the Entrance at time `02`. One of 4, 5, 8, and 9 were not in the room.
1. There are only four options to try where you exclude one of those four people. Just try them all.
1. `02-LI-5-8-9`

# 01-DI-7-8
1. `02-LI-5-8-9` will lead you to the next file.
1. Person 8 (Damian) says, "Vic just needed to make a quick call... We finished a moment ago."
1. At time `01`, Damian and Vic were in a room making a phone call.
1. Someone else mentioned making a call in the files you've discovered. (In the next hint, I'll tell you which file mentioned the phone.)
1. In `04-ST-1-5-8`, Person 5 says, "I'll go and call the police." Where did she go?
1. She went to `05-DI-1-5`.
1. You're looking for `01-DI-?????` where 8 is one of the numbers. The other is "Vic." Who's Vic?
1. Review `02-EN-1-6-7-10`.
1. This passage:
<blockquote>[7] Eddie! Look at the weather out there. You can't let him out in that!

<p>[6] Vic! We've enough guests as it is —</blockquote>
1. `01-DI-7-8`

# 03-KI-10-11
1. `02-EN-1-6-7-10` will lead you to the next location.
1. Person 10 (Eve) said, "Just wait here. I need... Oh God, where's Thornton..."
1. The next file is at time code `03`, and includes Person 10 (Eve).
1. Thornton is Person 11. Where _is_ Thornton at time `03`?
1. Review what Thornton says in `06-ST-1-11`.
1. "I spend most of my time in the Kitchen, sir — that's where I've been since we last spoke."
1. `03-KI-10-11`

# 02-KI-11
1. Now that you know where Thornton was at time `03`, where was he at time `02`?
1. He said he was there the whole time.
1. `02-KI-11`

# 05-KI-8-10-11
1. `04-ST-1-5-8` will lead you to the next file.
1. Person 8 (Damian) is going to find Thornton at time `05`.
1. Review what Thornton says in `06-ST-1-11`.
1. "I spend most of my time in the Kitchen, sir — that's where I've been since we last spoke."
1. The next file is `05-KI-?????` where 8 and 11 are present.
1. Someone else was present.
1. Who was there previously?
1. `05-KI-8-10-11`

# 06-ED-8-10
1. `05-KI-8-10-11` will lead you to the next file.
1. "Could you look after Miss Dauer for me? If you take her over to Edmund's room, I think she probably ought to lie down."
1. Person 8 (Damian) takes Person 10 (Eve) to Edmund's room at time `06`. What's the location code of his room?
1. `06-ED-8-10`

# 07-ED-10
1. `06-ED-8-10` will lead you to the next file.
1. "Note: no one else enters or leaves during the next scene, but I've included a sleeping scene anyway."
1. `07-ED-10`

# 00-act-structure
1. `07-ED-10` recommended that you search for a file by name.
1. `00-act-structure`

# 07-KI-11
1. `06-ST-1-11` will lead you to the next file.
1. It's at time `07`.
1. "Now, I am sorry, sir, but I'd better be heading off now to the Kitchen..."
1. `07-KI-11`

# 08-ED-4-10
1. `06-ED-8-10` and `07-ED-10` will lead you to the next file.
1. This passage:
<blockquote>[10] I want my brother.

<p>[8] I think I saw him earlier. I'll tell him to find you.</blockquote>
1. Person 10 is Eve. Who is Eve's brother?
1. `find brother`
1. This passage from `01-BI-06-10`:
<blockquote>[6] I'm not ignoring you, Eve, we just have other guests! Do you think I want to be talking to your damn brother all evening about his sad life? You know, he told me he joined the army for fun! I mean, come on!

<p>[10] Leave Tony out of this.</blockquote>
1. Tony is Eve's brother. He knocked at the door in `07-ED-10`
1. What's Tony's number?
1. `find Tony`
1. In `03-LI-1-4-5-6-7-8-9`, Person 5 says, "this is Victoria, Helen, Tony, Eddie and Damian."
1. John is 1, Eddie is 6, Victoria is 7, and Damian is 8. So Tony must be either Person 4 or Person 9.
1. `08-ED-4-10`

# 03-AT-2-3
1. `08-ED-4-10` will lead you to the next file.
1. Tony said, "But I think Oswald is up to something too... He and Annie were talking in the Attic while the rest of us had gathered in the Living room."
1. The Attic must be code `AT`. What time was everyone gathered in the Living room?
1. `03-AT-?????`. What numbered codes?
1. If there were two people in the attic at the time, only two numbers are unaccounted for.
1. `03-AT-2-3`

# 02-AT-2-4
1. `03-AT-2-3` will lead you to the next file.
1. "I swear, it wasn't me — it was Tony — I told him not to!"
1. Remember how we found this place? In `08-ED-4-10`, Tony said that Oswald and Annie were talking in the Attic.
1. Tony must have been in the attic with Annie before `03-AT-2-3`.
1. `02-AT-2-4`

# 01-AT-2
1. `02-AT-2-4` will lead you to the next file.
1. Annie was in here before Tony arrived.
1. `01-AT-2`

# 08-KI-1-6

# 10-TO-1-4
1. `09-DI-1-3` will lead you to the next file.
1. "You'll want to go and have a look in Tony's room."
1. That's what John did, at time `10`. (In the next hint, I'll tell you the location code of Tony's room.)
1. You're looking for `10-TO-?????` but since `10-TO-1` isn't it, there must have been someone else there.
1. Who would be in there?
1. `10-TO-1-4`

# 07-DI-1-2-4-5-6-7-8-9
1. `08-KI-1-6` will lead you to the next file.
1. Person 1 (John) said, "I was there at the Dining room table with everyone else!"
1. John was in the Study at time `06`, so he must have been in the Dining room at time `07`.
1. `07-DI-?????` where Person 1 was there, and lots of other people.
1. Review `09-DI-1-3`.
1. This passage:
<blockquote>[1] That reminds me... You were the only one not there when the rest of us were having dinner, right?

<p>[@] Note: he wasn't the only one.</blockquote>
1. Process of elimination will tell you who was in the Dining room at time `07`.
1. Not Person 3 (Oswald), and not 10 (Eve), because she was in Edmund's room, and not 11 (Thornton), because he was in the Kitchen.
1. `07-DI-1-2-4-5-6-7-8-9`

# 07-ST-3
1. `09-DI-1-3` will lead you to the next file.
1. This passage:
<blockquote>[1] That reminds me... You were the only one not there when the rest of us were having dinner, right?

<p>[@] Note: he wasn't the only one.

<p>[3] I was visiting the room that used to be the library, although it now seems to have been hastily turned into a bedroom of sorts. The floor was slightly sticky. And I found a note there about a performance of Dvorak's Humoresques, although I'd never heard of the pianist.</blockquote>
1. When everyone else was at dinner, at time `07`, Oswald was in another room. Which room fits that description?
1. The floor was sticky with wine.
1. `07-ST-3`

# 04-KI-3-10-11
1. `06-ST-1-11` will lead you to the next file.
1. This passage:
<blockquote>[11] Yes, sir — after the front door closed for a second time, a guest arrived in the Kitchen — she seemed rather inebriated. But nothing out of the ordinary.

<p>[1] And then?

<p>[11] Around the time the bottle smashed, a second guest arrived in the Kitchen. After he left, Mr Maseko arrived as I was tending to the inebriated guest and informed me I was needed here.</blockquote>
